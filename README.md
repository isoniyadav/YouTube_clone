## About the Project
This is a YouTube Clone application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The project replicates core functionalities of YouTube, such as user authentication, video upload and management, channel creation, commenting, and search functionality.

The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience across devices.

## Features

- **Channel Management**: Create and customize user channels.
- **Comments**: Post, edit, and delete comments on videos.
- **Search and Filter**: Search for videos and filter results based on criteria.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux, TailwindCSS (or your chosen CSS framework)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Cloud Storage**: (e.g., AWS S3, Firebase Storage, or any preferred option for video storage)
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
